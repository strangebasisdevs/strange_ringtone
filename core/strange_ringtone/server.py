"""The core HTTP server: routes, response headers and the checks before a render.

Plain http.server on purpose: the core is stdlib-only, sits behind a reverse
proxy that terminates TLS, and serves one request per connection. Every check
that decides whether a request is allowed lives in http_guard; this module
applies them in the order of docs/PLAN.md 5.2 and turns refusals into JSON.
